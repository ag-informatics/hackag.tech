# HACK AG.TECH

Join us to ideate, prototype, and explore digital solutions for resilient food and agricultural systems! In the lead up to this event, we will host online discussions to allow participants to connect, form teams, and identify projects of common interest.

At ASABE, we will spend the day together making prototypes, from conceptual diagrams, to web apps, and IoT systems - it’s a choose your own adventure! A laptop is required for this workshop.

An interest in digital agriculture is expected, with minimal programming experience. This is a hands-on experiential learning experience, and we encourage students from all disciplines to come! Pre-registration is required.

**[Register](https://bit.ly/hackagtech) by July 1.** We will be sending preparatory information and updating this site as we get closer to the event.

## FAQ

### What is the expected time commitment?
Prepatory work including team-formation and preparation of a pitch video is expected between July 1-8. A one-hour pitch session will happen on July 8, if you can't make the dedicated time, you can submit your pitch video in advance. Essentially, you get what you put in. A compelling project will require commitment from all team members, so be prepared to spend most of the actual hack-day (July 17) working on your project. There is a demo session on the July 20 - again, you can demo live or submit a video if you have a conflict.

### Is this mostly hardware, software, or what?
All of the above, but primarily leaning toward the development of information tools. So everything from: new sensors for on-farm data collection, new ways to visualization resource flows, mechanisms to handle data interoperability, to ways to connect existing open source software to support sustainable agricultural practices.

### How do teams work?

Between July 1-8 you can form a team using our dedicated slack channel. You should have an idea and a team (one or many), but it’s completely ok to switch teams, adjust teams, or even adjust whole ideas once you get here. This is a outcome-focused hackathon – we care only that we make the most compelling stuff for the open-agriculture technology community we possibly can! Here is an example hackathon group formation:

    - Problem owner and/or domain expert
    - Designer and/or architect
    - Programmers
    - Maybe a document writers /slide maker / coordinator

In the registration form, we ask about your areas of expertise so that we can lightly help with team formation as appropriate.

### I don’t code — what about me?

It completely depends on your project. The goal here is to create something compelling to the community. It is entirely possible to create a compelling data schema, or build out a compelling front-end design for a common application. While coding certainly helps, it is not required. Though, as stated before, you do need to have an idea coming in!
